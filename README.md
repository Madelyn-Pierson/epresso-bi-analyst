# E-Presso BI Analyst (starter)

> Replace this README as you build. Your final version should cover every section below.

## What this application does
_One paragraph for a manager, not a programmer._

## Live app
_URL here. Note that the app may take a moment to wake up._

## How to use it
_Upload files, use filters, ask the assistant. Include the file names and sheets it expects._

## Data model
_Grain of each table, keys, and how they are joined. Include your merge checks._

## Metric definitions
_What "revenue" means here, and anything it does not mean._

## Assistant
_State exactly what you built (live language-model agent, or rules-based assistant). List each tool, what it calculates, and what the assistant is not allowed to do._

## Validation
_Link to or summarize your Power BI comparison, independent check, and $1,000 test._

## Limitations
_Revenue is not profit. What else can this app not tell a manager?_
